# Facebook Group to WordPress

A simple plugin that imports posts from facebook groups to your WordPress blog, hourly!

> **Acknowledgement:**
> You shouldn't use this plugin to pull posts from the groups you didn't created. The author doesn't take any responsibility for any kind of abuse.

### What it does & doesn't

* Imports from facebook group and inserts as `fb_group_post` post type
* Displays them on home page and also assigns a category
* No chance for duplication
* Runs hourly via WordPress cron system
* Doesn't import historical posts yet
* Adds group id, author name and ID, post link as post meta

### Room for improvements
* Import historical (paginated) posts 
* Create seperate cron job to keep comments up to date.
